	the quiz below
---
question_list = [
#	(mark, 	count, [directories])
	(1, 7, ['hamming/fill_checkbits_0']), # <-- exists
	(1, 7, ['hamming/fill_checkbits_1']), # <-- exists

	(1, 7, ['hamming/XXXXXX']), # <-- doesn't exist; displayed as repeat of previous line
	#   ^---- note: this count is also bogus; might have something to do with it
]
practice_mode = True
standalone = False
logged = False
log_dir = ''
---

actual output:
	quiz presented with count as if nonexistent questions were present
	nonexistent questions are presented as repeats of the last existent question

	nonexistent questions should just not be displayed; if there are 5
	existent questions and 2 nonexistent ones, the quiz should have 5
	questions
FAULT DESCRIPTION:
	? investigate
