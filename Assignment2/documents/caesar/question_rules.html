<h2>Question type: caesar</h2>
Each caesar question displays an instruction indicating a key. Below this is a
table with two rows: a plaintext row, and a ciphertext row. Some letters in the
ciphertext may be replaced with textboxes.
<p>
To answer the question correctly, you must fill in each textbox with the
ciphertext letter obtained by encrypting the plaintext letter above it
with a caesar cipher using the given key.
