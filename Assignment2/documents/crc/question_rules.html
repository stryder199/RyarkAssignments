<h2>Question type: crc</h2>

Each crc question displays a CRC calculation in the "long division"
format shown in Andrew S. Tanenbaum - Computer Networks (4th
edition) and others.
<p>
The calculation is shown with missing bits. To answer the question
correctly, you must enter 0 or 1 into each of the text boxes, so that
the calculation is correct.
