<h2>Question type: dijkstra</h2>

Each dijkstra question displays an undirected weighted graph. Below
the graph is a table showing the node weights after successive
iterations of Dijkstra's algorithm, run on the graph.
<p>
The table is shown with missing values. To answer the question
correctly, you must enter the weights Dijkstra's algorithm would
have for these nodes during the indicated iterations.
