<h2>Question type: parity</h2>
Each parity question displays an instruction indicating either even or odd
parity. Below this is a 7-bit bitstring with a parity bit appended,
for a total of 8 bits. Some of the bits are select menus.
<p>
To answer the question correctly, you must select 0 or 1 from each of the
menus, so that the parity is correct according to the instruction.
